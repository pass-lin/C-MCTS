To answer, first find the smallest distance between the center of the country and its border. To find the area of the largest circular disk that can be inscribed in the United States, we need to determine the smallest distance between the center of the country and its border. This distance will be the radius of the largest inscribed circle. Once we have the radius, we can calculate the area of the circle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the center of the United States:**\n   - The United States is roughly rectangular in shape, stretching from the Canadian border in the north to Florida in the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west.\n   - A good approximation for the center of the United States is the geographic center, which is near Lebanon, Kansas.\n\n2. **Determine the smallest distance from the center to the border:**\n   - We need to find the shortest distance from Lebanon, Kansas to the nearest point on the border of the United States.\n   - The boundary of the continental United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) is relatively straight on a map.\n   - By examining the map, the shortest distance from Lebanon, Kansas to the border is approximately 215 miles (346 km). This is the distance to the Missouri River, which forms part of the southern border of the state of Missouri.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the inscribed circle:**\n   - The radius \\( r \\) of the largest inscribed circle is 215 miles.\n   - The area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - Substituting the radius, we get:\n     \\[\n     A = \\pi (215)^2 = \\pi \\times 46225 \\approx 145802.5 \\text{ square miles}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the largest circular disk that can be inscribed in the United States is \\(\\boxed{145802.5}\\) square miles."
